three stages of reproducible work flow 
data collection 
data processing 
data analysis 


lets look at given problem 
Data can be collected in the following ways 
 Collect data from an existing source 
 If we want large dataset, get through web-scraping 
Get from other researchers
Generate through simulation 

And Save it in an .csv format 

Later apply data cleaning on the dataset by checking for null values and change to binary values 

Do data analysis by printing model parameters
